Values are being input from a sensor in a car. The sensor, namely Proximity, reads the distance from the car in your front and output the "WARNING" when distance from the car in front is less than 10 meters.

Write an algorithm that input sensor reading for INFINITE and warn if the maintained distance falls below 10 meters.
